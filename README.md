The Liverpool Ringing Simulator Project

<b>The Type 1 simulator is no longer under active development. The repository for the Type 2 simulator is at https://github.com/Simulators/simulator-type2, and you should start there if you are building a new simulator.<b>

Here you will find archived all the resources for building the Liverpool Ringing Simulator Project's original (Type 1) simulator interfaces and sensor heads, including:
* Hardware & Software Manuals
* Firmware Source Code
* Eagle PCB Designs
* PCB Fabrication Gerber Files

If you didn't get here from http://www.simulators.org.uk/, you might want to go and look at that, too.
