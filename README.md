The Liverpool Ringing Simulator Project


Here you will find archived all the resources for building the Liverpool Ringing Simulator Project's original (Type 1) simulator interfaces and sensor heads, including:
* Hardware & Software Manuals
* Firmware Source Code
* Eagle PCB Designs
* PCB Fabrication Gerber Files

You probably want to start in the documentation folder...

If you didn't get here from http://www.simulators.org.uk/, you might want to go and look at that, too.
