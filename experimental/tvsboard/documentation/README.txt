An experimental daughter board for the Simulator Interface Board.

One of the shortcomings of the original Simulator Interface Board is the lack of
TVS protection against induced voltage spikes on the signal and power supply lines between
the Sensor Heads and the Simulator Interface.

This experimental board provides TVS protection for these connections in the form of
a daughter board which can be mounted on the Simulator Interface Board sensor connector,
and provides protected connections for the sensors.

The board is mounted onto the Simulator Interface Board with two male-to-female M3 threaded
nylon spacers, 12mm long, and suitable nylon M3 pan head screws and nuts.

The component used is the SA5.0A uni-directional TVS diode from Littlefuse, one per sensor line.

This is suitable for Simulator Interface board Rev C. It is not required for Rev D boards which incorporate the diodes on the main PCB.
